 # Two dimensional Arrays

 You might have noticed we haven't shown you how build a 2D grid of cells. We'll need one for Game of Life so let's get started!

 When we introduced arrays, we said that arrays can represent a list of _any_ type. What if... a variable was initialized to be an array of _arrays_?

*/

var grid: [[Character?]] = []

/*:

 That's right. The double brackets mean that `grid` is a variable of type "`Array` of `Arrays` of `Character` optionals". This is just a convoluted way of saying a "2D grid of optional `Character`s". And just like in previous examples, we can append values to `grid`. The only difference is those values have to be of type `[Character?]`!

 - callout(Try it out):

        let column = [Character?](repeating: nil, count: 10)
        grid.append(column)

 
 - note: The initializer for column is a special _constructor_ syntax that lets you quickly set an array with a count of repeated values.

 
 We now have a column of empty cells!

 
 - callout(Challenge): Try utilizing some for-loop logic to append 8 of these empty columns to make a 8x10 grid.

*/





/*:

 Indexing from a 2D grid is simple: You simply use the subscript operator twice ‚Äì¬†once for the outer array, and then again for the array inside that indexed outer array. In this example, this translates to x and y coordinates of the grid.

    grid[1][2] = "üê±"

 This would modify the cell at the _second column_ and _third row_ of the grid.

 - experiment: Use this syntax to make yourself a nice pattern of `Character`s on your new 8x10, two dimensional grid!

 
 - important: grid[0][0] represents the bottom-left corner.

*/












//: - important: Remember that `Array`s are zero-indexed in Swift. `[0]` represents the first value!
//:
//: [Previous](@previous) | [Next](@next)




























/*:
Don't worry about this code. It handles the display.
