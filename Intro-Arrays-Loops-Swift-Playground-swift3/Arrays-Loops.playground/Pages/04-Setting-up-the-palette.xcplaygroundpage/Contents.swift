 # Setting up the palette

 ## Back to arrays

 `nil` is going to be handy in order to represent empty buckets in our palette of Characters, but first we need to modify our `palette` variable to be of the right type. Now instead of being an array of `Character`s, our palette is going to be an array of `Character` optionals:

 */

var palette: [Character?] = []

/*:

 - callout(Challenge): Using our newfound knowledge of for-loops and Optionals, set the palette to an array of size 8:

    - Make the first 5 elements are set to "🐱"
    - Make the remaining 3 elements empty (`nil`).

    The display on the right will tell you if your array is correct: if any of your cells light up red, that's an incorrect value! Refer back to the previous pages if you need a refresher on syntax.

//: [Previous](@previous) | [Next](@next)

 Don't worry about this code. It handles the display.
