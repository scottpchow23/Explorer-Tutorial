 # Dictionaries and Optionals Extended Challenge
 
 ## A more robust contact book
 
 In this exercise, we will extend our previous challenge code to be more robust.
 
 ### Extended challenge
 
 Now that we have some basic code, it's time to "refactor" it!
 
 1. Create a `ContactBook` class. It should have the same functionality as the previous challenge, including `addContact`, `findContact`, `updateContact`, `deleteContact`, and `allContacts` methods.
 1. Create a `ContactDetails` class. Replace your values with this class and update your methods accordingly. You'll want to update what they print out to make sense. We're going to leave this pretty open ended for you but here are some other values to consider: home phone, cell phone, email, Facebook profile, LinkedIn profile. How will you store these? Maybe you should use optionals... hint hint ;)
 1. Create a few `ContactBook` objects and add data to them. Test them out!
 
 - callout(Additional Challenge): Try implementing a favorite contacts feature in `ContactBook`. All these contacts should be accessable via the normal methods but you should also include a new `favoriteContacts` method that only prints out your favorites!
