 # A wild bear appears!

 Zoe says your program is really helping her keep track of the tigers! As a result, Zoe has been promoted at the zoo. She's now in charge of tigers and bears, which means your program now needs to describe bear behaviors as well!

 - callout(Challenge): Create a class called `Bear`, which should be very similar to your `Tiger` class. The `Bear` class should also have `name` and `favoriteFood` instance variables, because `Bear`s have a `name` and a `favoriteFood`, just like `Tiger`s. The initializer method should take one argument, `name`, and set the `name` instance variable to its given value, and `favoriteFood` to `"fish"`.  The `eat` method for the `Bear` class should also be exactly the same as in the `Tiger` class. Remember, if `eat` is called with anything other than their `favoriteFood` then it will sleep!  _`Bear`s sleep very differently than `Tiger`s, so the `sleep` method for the `Bear` class should instead print `"<name> hibernates for 4 months"` instead to reflect the difference in their sleeping behavior._

 Finally, create `Tiger` and `Bear` objects, and then call their `eat` method to test its behavior.

 */

class Tiger {
    // copy your Tiger class from the previous section!

}

class Bear {
    // complete the Bear class here!

}

 ## Testing

 When you're done, uncomment the below lines of code, and it should output the following:

    Tigger eats meat
    YUM!!! Tigger wants more meat
    Tigger eats kibble
    Tigger sleeps for 8 hours
    Pooh eats fish
    YUM!!! Pooh wants more fish
    Pooh eats meat
    Pooh hibernates for 4 months

 - callout(Hint): Refer to the previous page if you need any help!
